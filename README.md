🧠 Sentiment Analysis in Python
A machine learning project built to classify sentiments from text data using supervised learning algorithms. This project enhances practical skills in Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

🔍 Overview
This sentiment analysis system aims to detect whether a text expresses a positive or negative sentiment. The project leverages classical machine learning techniques and NLP preprocessing steps to build a predictive model.

🧰 Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language

Pandas / NumPy: Data manipulation

Scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.)

NLTK / re: Text cleaning and natural language preprocessing

Matplotlib / Seaborn: Data visualization

🔄 Workflow
Data Cleaning: Remove stopwords, punctuations, and lowercase transformation

Text Vectorization: Using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer

Model Training: Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes

Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Prediction: Real-time sentiment prediction from new texts

📈 Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of XX% (substitua pelo valor real) and showed strong performance on both training and testing sets. The confusion matrix and classification report indicate the model generalizes well.
