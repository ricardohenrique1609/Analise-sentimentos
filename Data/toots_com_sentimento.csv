barefootstache yeah the python ecosystem has bunch of options development tools that various things pyenv venv and virtualenv in particular are not at all meant to the same thing poetry the closest equivalents to poetry are things like hatch flit and pdm and kind of uv well although its little complicated because poetry does several different things and i dont believe any of those tools are an exact equivalent all of the things poetry doesyou might find this an interesting read httpsalpopkescompostspythonpackagingtoolsthe landscape of packaging tools has changed somewhat since then eg rye has been absorbed into uv but i think most of it is still fairly accurate and the point of reading this is not so much to understand which specific tool does what its to understand the different tasks that python has tools and how you can cover them using one tool or multiple different tools working together whatever you like,2025-01-21 01:12:00+00:00,diazona,positivo

after programming good 2 months in python finally found the tool poetry which is quite similar to how nodejs bundles libraries into directory either locally or globally in the cache directoryi have tried the other tools from pyenv to venv andor virtualenv where i thought they were used to deal with library dependency management only to realize that they are more like nvmi did use conda some time though preferred python only solution i realize that poetry wont resolve all issues and might need to look into to containerization later on though the time period it looks like good solution,2025-01-21 00:39:15+00:00,barefootstache,positivo
